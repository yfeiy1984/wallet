The MT blockchain is a fully decentralized social media platform focused on blockchain related content using blockchain technology, adopting an innovative approach that allows users to have the power to create and disseminate valued content compared to traditional social media platforms. The user evaluation - token incentive model rewards contributors (including community builders, content providers and communicators) who create value content for the platform, and provides MTS rewards for these contributors. The goal is to link people and blockchain related content together, and to ensure that the content is valuable to the users. The voting also allows information to bring monetary worth back to quality content.
